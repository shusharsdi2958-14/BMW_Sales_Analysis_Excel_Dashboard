## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an interactive Excel dashboard designed to analyze BMW’s global sales performance from 2010 to 2024.  

The dashboard converts raw sales data into structured insights, enabling performance monitoring and strategic decision-making through dynamic KPIs and visualizations.

It provides a consolidated business view of revenue trends, model performance, regional contribution, fuel segmentation, and Year-over-Year (YoY) growth.

## 💼 Business Problem

Global automotive companies generate massive multi-year sales data across models, regions, and product categories. Without structured reporting:

- Revenue trends are difficult to interpret  
- Growth patterns remain unclear  
- High-performing models are not easily identified  
- Regional contributions lack visibility  
- Strategic planning becomes complex  

This dashboard solves these challenges by delivering clear, interactive, and KPI-driven insights.
